            <h2>What I found</h2>
            <p>I extracted the top 250 restaurants in Hong Kong Island in terms of collections for analysis, and the average number of food reviews they received was 449 and the average good reviews rate was 70.7.I calculated the number of positive reviews and ratings of restaurants compared to the average from different dimensions to get the conclusion.</p>

          <h3>Money spent and the pleasure enjoyed may not be positively correlated</h3>
          <p>People's consumption level is concentrated in $100-400, and people in this consumption range give more positive comments to the restaurant. Restaurants that cost a lot are with high praise rate too.</p>

          <h3>Hong Kong people do not love Hong Kong style restaurants?</h3>
          <p>Hong Kong Island has the most Japanese and Western restaurants, far more than even the two other restaurants of any kind added together.But Hong Kong-style restaurants do not seem to be very popular with the lowest good rating in this graph?</p>

          <h3><br>In the long tail,Sichuan cuisine seems to be the most promising</h3>
          <p>Hong Kong Island has different local flavor restaurants, people can taste different types of food without leaving Hong Kong, in these rare restaurants for Sichuan cuisine is more highly rated.</p>

          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>I respectively as a diner and as a product manager of the platform side from the data obtained from the consideration, some recommendations are as follows</p>
        <section class="Recommendation-item">
          <img src="images/competing restaurant.png" alt="banner">
          <h3>The best Japanese and hongkongfood in the hearts of diners </h3>
          <p>There may be many good restaurants in each genre, but I highly recommend going for the Hong Kong and Japanese style with the highest collection.The former is because local food recognized by locals is usually more authentic.The latter is because they stand out in the fiercest competition. Fancy or simple according to the person's budget</p>
        </section>
        <section class="Recommendation-item">
          <h3>I would encourage such restaurants to join... </h3>
          <p>Option1: Open a Japanese restaurant or a Western restaurant in a location that is not busy and has a very low rating like Queensway, Happy Valley, Taikoo.The reason is that there are currently no good restaurants in this zone, while Japanese and Western food are popular restaurants and have a greater competitiveness after moving in.</p>
          <p>Option2:Sichuan cuisine restaurants open in most locations will have a good future. As a long tail, Szechuan restaurants have an average evaluation rate and good reviews that far exceed those of other restaurants, and should be profitable as long as the location is not too remote</p>
          <p>Option3:There is still room for restaurants in the range of 400 to 800, personal advice is  French cuisine which is always expensive to go into this area, create a cost-effective and high-quality brand would be fine.</p>

                    <img src="images/openrice robot txt.png" alt="banner">
                    <p>From a platform perspective,Openrice is a 2-sided business model. It needs more users to participate in the content production to attract merchants to settle in. At the same time, more merchants will attract more users to visit this website.</p><p> I am interested in users who produce content posting habits and behavioral motivation However, I search the Openrice’s robot text, in which I found that user information is protected.</p>

                    <h3>Graphical scoring system can not be grabbed?</h3>
                     <p>I found that when the rating criteria such as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ and ‘ok’ are expressed using images with no text description, so the data cannot be grabbed, how to get this data?. </p>
