            <h4>Restful Api</h4>
            <h2>Using postman/airtable/Jupyter notebook</h2>
            <p>For assignment 1</p>
            <p>This time for the first assignment, I first used Postman to modify the data in the user table. First, I imported JWT tokens in a Flask API that I learned in class and followed the steps to add the protection to my API. And then I add login authentication to release the access token. In the process of obtaining user information, I tried to obtain all the lists and individual users. I went through the post, put, delete method smoothly. I think the most important thing about this assignment is to be careful not to miss any steps.</p>
              
            <p>For setting up the blog API, I found that the database I set up last term was not sufficiently comprehensive, such as the blog was not connected to the user's ID, only having the author.
              So in the future, it would not be able to connect the relevant databases if it was necessary to provide this type of API.</p>
              . </p>
            <p>For assignment 2</p>    
            <p>After uploading the database to Airtable, I did some operations on it, such as connecting the comment ID and the blog ID in a one-to-many relationship.
              I also tested the API in Postman first before exchanging data in Jupyter notebook. I reviewed the Airtable API documentation to understand how to make requests to the database but encounter problems when copying the codes in class. And I found that it proved to be the “prams” problem that prevent me from going through the list during extracting data. After I delete this line of code, it can get and display data in a structured format. Other requests have also been tried and the records were successfully validated.
